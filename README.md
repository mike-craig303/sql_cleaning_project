# sql_cleaning_project

#This is a SQL cleaning project using PostgreSQL which I completed in order to make visualizations in Tableau of my transition from owning and operating a bakery to becoming a data analyst. The data used in this project is 7 years (2013-2020) of item sales data from Square (the POS my bakery used) but I am not uploading the actual data sets as they are private. The goal of this project is to document my cleaning process and demonstrate my abilities writing queries and wrangling data for further analysis.
